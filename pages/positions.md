# Positions

The laboratory of Professor Chenfei Wang at Tongji University invites applicants for the positions listed below. The research in the laboratory focuses on developing computational algorithms to decipher mechanisms of phenotypic-driven cell identity changes using single-cell spatial multi-omics. 

### Computational biology postdoc position at the Wang Lab
Computational biology postdocs will be working on developing AI-based algorithms and data mining projects to model cell identity changes in cancer immunology, aging, and developmental system. The postdoc fellow will be working on single-cell multi-omics, spatial multi-omics, single-cell CRISPR screens dataset analyses. The full-time postdoctoral compensation is 300K-420K RMB/year, with additional performance reward up to 90K.

Requirements:<br/><br/>
    1. Ph.D. degree in bioinformatics, computation science, physics or statistics.   
    2. Strong programming skills(Python or C or C++ or Java and R).   
    3. Strong computational genomics experiences or machine learning background.   
    4. At least one first-authored English paper published in Bioinformatics or above.   
    5. Interested applicants should submit CV, a letter of interest with a one-page proposal for a project to be conducted in the Wang Lab to [Dr. Wang](mailto:08chenfeiwang@tongji.edu.cn)  with the subject line "Computational postdoctoral application".   

### Experimental biology postdoc position at the Wang Lab
Experimental biology postdocs will be working on adopting or developing cutting-edge genomics technologies like single-cell multi-omics, spatial multi-omics, and single-cell CRISPR screens to understand mechanisms of cell identity changes in cancer immunology, aging, and developmental system. The full-time postdoctoral compensation is  300K-420K RMB/year, with additional performance reward up to 90K.

Requirements:<br/><br/>
    1. Ph.D. degree in biology.   
    2. Strong molecular, cell biology, and genomics skills.   
    3. At least one first-authored English paper published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry or above.   
    4. Motivation, independence, and creativity.   
    5. Interested applicants should submit CV, a letter of interest with a one-page proposal for a project to be conducted in the Wang Lab to [Dr. Wang](mailto:08chenfeiwang@tongji.edu.cn)  with the subject line "Experimental postdoctoral application".
